# Javascript-Challenge

## Background
This project uses information that tracks possible UFO sightings.

There is just one tiny problem though... the collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

## Task
Create a basic HTML web page.

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
